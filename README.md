# Antibiotic-Resistance-Prediction

This work was part of my 4th year machine learning research project with Dr. Laurence Yang at Queen's University. The goal of this project is to classify isolates of
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa as resistant or susceptbile to a common antibiotic, tobramycin. The classifiers are trained on gene sequence data for the orfN gene, which has been shown to mutate to convey tobramycin resistance. 

This work has clinical relevance as a possible antimicrobial susceptbility testing (AST) method that uses a relatively low amount of data compared to existing techniques which often use entire genomes.
