# Antibiotic-Resistance-Prediction

This work was part of my 4th year machine learning research project with Dr. Laurence Yang at Queen's University. The goal of this project is to classify isolates of
_Pseudomonas Aeruginosa_ as resistant or susceptbile to a common antibiotic, tobramycin. The classifiers are trained on gene sequence data for the _orfN_ gene, which has been shown to mutate to convey tobramycin resistance. 

This work has clinical relevance as a possible antimicrobial susceptbility testing (AST) method that uses a relatively low amount of data compared to existing techniques which often use entire genomes.
